# Configuration for the `eza` command-line tool

This directory contains the configuration file for the `eza` command-line tool.

## Usage

Copy the `theme.yml` file to the `%USERPROFILE%\.config\eza` directory. Please observe that `.yml` is the extension and eza does not recognize `.yaml` extension (for some reason).
